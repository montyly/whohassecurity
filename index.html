                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What counts as having security?</h3>
                    <p>Having an internal security person. This person can be a protocol security engineer, a CISO, or another security role. The definition is not strict. Our goal is to promote having internal security, not to evaluate companies.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Is this list really accurate?</h3>
                    <p>No. Our goal is not to do a strict evaluation, but simply to promote having internal security. Companies listed here might still have bad practices, but at least they demonstrated interest in internal security.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>My company is too small for a dedicated security person. What should I do?</h3>
                    <p>That's okay. You can join the list once you grow. In the meantime, make sure security is explicitly owned by someone. A security-minded cofounder who's paranoid enough can be a good choice.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Why does this matter?</h3>
                    <p>Most protocols spend a lot of money on external code reviews, audit contests, and bug bounties, but miss the opportunity to build an internal team and really own their security. Security is not something you can fully outsource, and we want to promote better practices in the space.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I add my protocol to the list?</h3>
                    <p>Open a PR on GitHub with the relevant information to verify you have a security person. If you prefer not to share public proof, reach out to <a href="https://x.com/Montyly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">x/montyly</a> (@montyly on Telegram) with reasonable proof.</p>
